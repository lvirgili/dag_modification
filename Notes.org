* Notes on the code
** dagmdf
*** File depdendencies
    1. x_io.c
    2. x_form.c
    3. x_relax.c
    4. x_list.c
    5. tvms.c
*** First things first: main, the beginning.
    - It is in the 'tvms.c' file.
    - The first integer passed as a parameter (argv[1]) can be:
      + 0: BCL
      + 1: OPTMIZER
    - Then it ignores argv[2].
    - argv[3] is read into timeUnit.
    - After this it compares argv[2] with "dint" and "drr" to consider
      if only the 4 first contraints should be considered. In the
      examples I have only "int" is passed in argv[2], so I shall
      ignore this possibilities for now.
    - Then it reads the files passed. In the example given it reads
      all three files with the "readInputFiles". goto: I/O;
*** x_dag.c
    - The functions mdfDagOpc1 and mdfDagOpc2 modify the digraphs. The
      second one generates all the possible ones, so I will not use
      it. Have to find out which method in the article is used in
      function one.
*** I/O
    - x_dag.c, lines 348-50 print the graph in a file.
    - add fileName to x_io.h and read it from cl.


*** Find out what timeUnit does.
