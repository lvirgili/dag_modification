* Notes on the code
** dagmdf
*** File depdendencies
    1. x_io.c
    2. x_form.c
    3. x_relax.c
    4. x_list.c
    5. tvms.c
*** First things first: main, the beginning.
    - It is in the 'x_dag.c' file.
*** x_dag.c
    - The functions mdfDagOpc1 and mdfDagOpc2 modify the digraphs. The
      second one generates all the possible ones, so I will not use
      it. Have to find out which method in the article is used in
      function one.
*** I/O
    - x_dag.c, lines 348-50 print the graph in a file.
    - add fileName to x_io.h and read it from cl.

*** TODO Implement functions to print the matricse
